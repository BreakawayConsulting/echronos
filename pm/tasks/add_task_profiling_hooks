# Motivation

- A debugging feature to monitor active tasks, profile number of calls, and sequence for a given duration and sytem activity.

# Goals

- Extend ```yield_to``` such that if the task profiling hook is provided, it will be called with arguments of the task id starting yielding and next task id which could potentially become runnable.
- Note this extension is only applicable to rigel variant of eChronos.

# Release Impact: Minor

# Test Plan

- All regressin tests pass
