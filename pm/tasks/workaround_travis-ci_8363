# Motivation

The latest release of Travis CI introduced an issue with the behaviour of pyenv, which
can be seen at https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/8363. This is breaking the
tests in the echronos repository.

# Goals

Have the Travic CI tests succeeding again.

# Release Impact: Patch

# Test Plan

Check https://travis-ci.org/echronos/echronos/branches to see whether the tests succeed for this branch.
