# Motivation

Functions in the _public_privileged_function_declarations_ section in base templates, such as _components/acamar/header.h_, are not declared as _extern "C"_ to disable C++ name mangling. This can be reproduced by running the command _x.py build packages_ and looking at the file _packages/posix/rtos-acamar/rtos-acamar.h_.

# Goals

- The overall goal of this task is to ensure that all API functions are declared so that C++ mangling does not occur.
- Functions declared in the _public_privileged_function_declarations_ section of base templates need to be enclosed in an _extern "C"_ block when generating package templates.

# Release Impact: Major

# Test Plan

- verify that the task goals are met by manually inspecting generated package templates
- verify that all existing regression tests pass
- verify that the release impact is documented correctly
