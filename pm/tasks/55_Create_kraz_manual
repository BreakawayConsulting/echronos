# Motivation

There is currently no manual for the kraz variant of the RTOS.

# Goals

- Add missing information to be be able to build a manual for kraz variants.
- Adjust existing information so that a kraz manual is consistent with the kraz implementation.

# Release Impact: Patch

# Test Plan

- Verify that all regression tests pass
- Verify that the task goals are met by building the manuals (x.py build docs) and review the kraz manuals to contain accurate and complete information about the kraz RTOS variant
