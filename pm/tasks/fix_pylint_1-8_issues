# Motivation

The command `x.py test style` currently uses the pylint static analysis tool to find syntactic and sematic issues in the Python source code.
The pylint package has recently been updated from the currently supported version 1.7 to version 1.8.
This version reports issues that version 1.7 does not detect.
Therefore, the command `x.py test style` fails with the current version of pylint.

# Goals

The main goal of this task is for the `x.py test style` command to not fail with pylint version 1.8.
The Python code that causes the issues reported by pylint 1.8 shall be updated and improved for pylint to pass.

# Release Impact: Patch

# Test Plan

- Update pylint with the command `pip3 install --upgrade pylint`
- Run the command `x.py test style` and verify that it completes successfully and without reporting issues
