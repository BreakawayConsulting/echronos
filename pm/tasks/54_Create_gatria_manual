# Motivation

There is currently no manual for the gatria variant of the RTOS.

# Goals

- Add missing information to be be able to build a manual for gatria variants.
- Adjust existing information so that a gatria manual is consistent with the gatria implementation.

# Release Impact: Patch

# Test Plan

- Verify that all regression tests pass.
- Verify that the task goals are met by building the manuals (x.py build docs) and review the gatria manuals to contain accurate and complete information about the gatria RTOS variant.
