# Motivation

- The RTOS does not currently have any regression tests for its ARMv7m support.

# Goals

- Create system tests for ARMv7m RTOS variants, updating QEMU if required.
- Add these tests to CI, where required updating the test setup scripts with prerequisites.

# Release Impact: Patch

# Test Plan

- Code review
- Existing regression tests must pass
- System tests for ARMv7m RTOS variants must have been added, and must pass
