# Motivation

- The RTOS does not currently have any regression tests for its ARMv7m support.

# Goals

- Create system tests for all variants supported on ARMv7m.
- Add these tests to CI, where required updating the test setup scripts with prerequisites.

# Test Plan

- Code review
- Existing regression tests must pass
- System tests for all supported variants on ARMv7m must have been added and must pass
