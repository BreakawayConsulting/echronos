# Welcome!

You are new around here?
Welcome to the project - we are glad to have you!

If you have any questions, send us an e-mail to echronos@trustworthy.systems or tweet at us [@echronosrtos](https://twitter.com/echronosrtos).

If there is something in the project that you think is worth improving, please create a [github issue](https://github.com/echronos/echronos/issues).

# Contributing

We have a few basic rules for how contributing works exactly:

- [contributor agreements](#contributor-agreements)
- [pull requests](#pull-requests)

## Contributor Agreements

All contributors to the eChronos RTOS need to supply a scan of a signed copy of the eChronos Contributor Assignment Agreement.
There is a version of the agreement for [individuals](https://ts.data61.csiro.au/projects/TS/echronos/CAA-individual.pdf) and a version for [companies](https://ts.data61.csiro.au/projects/TS/echronos/CAA-entity.pdf).
In summary, this agreement signs over your copyright and intellectual property on the contributions you make to CSIRO Australia, which helps them manage this project.

## Pull Requests

Contributions to the eChronos RTOS are made through GitHub pull requests, like for most other projects on GitHub.
We have a few requirements in place, such as PRs needing to be signed off by at least one reviewer and to pass the automated regression tests to ensure a high degree of code quality.
